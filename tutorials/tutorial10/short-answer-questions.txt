Please answer the following two questions:

1. What is a join (just in your own words) and why is it useful?
A join is a query statement that allows the joining of adjacent values between two tables.
It is useful for adding values from an existing table into another table.



2. Consider the structure of the posts table: why would you want to use a foreign key (user_id) to the users table instead of storing the username, first_name, and last_name in the posts table?
The purpose of the user id is to locate an exact user with a specific user id, so simply searching for the user id is more exact compared to looking for the username, first name and last name 
because they are specific to just one user.
